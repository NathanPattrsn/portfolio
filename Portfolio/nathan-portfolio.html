                <p>I started my journey into the world of Web Design & Development when I was undertaking a level 2 course at my college, St John Rigby and this is where I first learned to code websites and design them. This was only the surface.</p>
                <p>After having finished my course at college with D*D*D* grade, equivalent to 3 A*s at A-Level, I began studying Web Design & Development at university, Edge Hill University. This is where my knowledge, skills and expertise started to come into play and grow stronger than ever. </p>

                    <p>This project was to celebrate the 100 years of amazing work done by Stan Lee and the main aim of this project was to work as a team of four and create a website
                        dedicated to Stan Lee. Along with this, an API had to be implemented to call his work from the Marvel Site to our section of our website. 
                        This involved communication well via Teams and pushing/pulling our changed code/work to GitHub.

                        make it an event and save it. After saving it, it would highlight your selected day in a light red and display your text below the date, all using some HTML and JavaScript.
